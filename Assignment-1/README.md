# BIO 665 - Assignment 1

### Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to help you become more familiar with basic R coding.

First, please install [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com) (the open source edition) on your personal computer.

Second, make sure you have completed the instructions on the [homepage](/BYUBioinformatics/BIO665) for this repository.

Now use the `cd` command to change your working directory to your `BIO665` directory. Then create a directory called `Assignment-1` in that directory.

```
mkdir Assignment-1
```

Now `cd` into the `Assignment-1` directory.

### Problem descriptions

*Please let me know if you see any errors in these problem descriptions or in the expected outputs. Thanks!*

Read the instructions carefully for each problem listed below. For each of the problems, you should write an R script called `X.R` (but replace `X` with the problem number). For example, for problem 1, the R script would be named `1.R`. Store these scripts in the `Assignment-1` directory.

1. Declare a variable called `greeting` and assign a value of `Hello, world!` to that variable. Then print the value of this variable in your script.

2. Declare a variable called `greeting2` and assign a value of `Goodbye, world!` to that variable. Then print the value of this variable in your script.

3. If you have successfully installed the latest versions of R and RStudio, print `TRUE` in your script.

### Committing your code

After you complete the problems, stage and commit your scripts to your GitHub repository. You can commit your code using the following three commands (replace `<message>` with an actual message that describes what you are doing):

```
git add --all
git commit -m "<message>"
git push origin master
```

### Checking your answers

You can use [this site](http://bonsai.byu.edu:9000) to check your code after you have committed it to GitHub. It will tell you whether your code produces output that matches the expected output. Let me know if you encounter any problems as you use this site. **This site is only available from BYU campus.**

### Submitting to Learning Suite

After completing this assignment, go to Learning Suite and submit the URL of your repository for Assignment 1. I will download your code and test it.
